## We will continue using Matplotlib to investigate the contours in our dataset. 

### Atom/GitHub

Pull upstream from GitHub to get the latest Atom script on your computer.
It is called `eddy_contours_script_032819.py` and is in your labs folder.

### Write a function to extract contour lines!

- We are moving full steam ahead toward our final task: A script that identifies the eddies in our dataset. To do this, our goal is to put all of the contour lines and their values into a dataframe.

- To start, we want to bypass the complicated process Matplotlib has for selecting individual contour lines. We'll write a function called `get_contours`. This function will take in a contour set (i.e., the variable we have assigned  to the output of `plt.contour`), as well as an index that indicates which contour level we want to access.

- The output will be an integer that tells us the value of the contour level (i.e., the elevation or sea surface height), as well as a list that contains the Path objects that represent every contour line along that contour level.

- For example, `get_contours(contour_set, 2)` might return the value `10` — the elevation or contour value — and a list like this:
``` 
[Path(array([[294.82619048,  37.125     ],
        [294.625     ,  37.03749569],
        [294.375     ,  37.03036198],
        [294.16096021,  37.125     ]]), None),
 Path(array([[299.375     ,  35.61776641],
        [299.34537572,  35.625     ],
        [299.23674242,  35.875     ],
        [299.375     ,  35.92704373],
        [299.55629139,  35.875     ],
        [299.40559701,  35.625     ],
        [299.375     ,  35.61776641]]), None)]
```
- **Check your understanding**: How many contour lines are there for the elevation/contour value of 10?

- To do this, you will want **two** values in your return statement, i.e.
```
  return level_value, contour_list
```

- You may need a for loop.

### Dataframes

- **Recalling prior knowledge**: What library do you use to create dataframes? How is data stored in dataframes? How can you make a dataframe in Python? 
  - Talk with your partner and look back at Year 1 notes to refresh your memory.

- We want to create a dataframe with just two columns: `level` and `contour_path`. Every row will contain a single contour path object and the contour level associated with it. This way, we can look at each contour line individually.

Steps:

1. Create an empty dataframe with the column names 'level' and 'contour_path'.

2. Choose a single level and set of contour lines for practice (i.e., run `get_contours(contour_set, index)`) and use that output to build your code for now. Assign both variables a variable name.

3. What does the code below do? Talk about it with your partner. How might this be useful?

  `df1 = pd.DataFrame({'level': level, 'contour_path': contour_paths})`

4. Read up on [DataFrame.append](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.append.html). How is it similar to techniques you've used in the past with lists? Can you adapt old code for this problem?
 - If you need a for loop, what values do you want to loop over (what value do you want to change on every iteration?) Talk with your partner about it before coding.


5.  Write your code!



Here is an example of what our dataframe should look like, where each contour line (not collection!) gets its own row.
```
        level	  contour_path
0	-0.70  	  Path(array([[294.4202381 , 37.125 ],\n ...]])
1	-0.69	  Path(array([[294.62777778, 37.125 ],\n ...]])
2	-0.68	  Path(array([[294.64761905, 37.125 ],\n ...]])
3	-0.67	  Path(array([[294.66746032, 37.125 ],\n ...]])
4	-0.66	  Path(array([[294.68730159, 37.125 ],\n ...]])
```
