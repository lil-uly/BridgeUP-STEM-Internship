Contour maps, or topographic maps, are a great way to represent 3D data in 2D. Each contour line in a map connects *all* points of equal elevation.

### Activity 1: Read the map

With your partner, look at the map above and try to answer the following questions:


2. What do the numbers beside some of the contour lines represent?
  - Based on this information, can you approximate the increase in height between each contour line?


2. What can you infer about the spacing of contour lines? If contour lines are closer together, is the topography/landscape steeper, less steep or neither?

3. Do contour lines ever cross?

4. Try drawing the transect between A and B. (i.e., draw how elevation changes across Rock Mountain over the line from A to B). 

5. What shape is used to represent mountains? What shape is used to represent rivers or downstream valleys? (Hint: Look at Fish Creek)

### Activity 2: What the heck can a potato teach us about topography?

1. On your half-potato, draw at least 2 lines of constant elevation, all the way around the potato. Make sure you're measuring the different heights relative to the table or a hard surface, with the ruler sticking straight up. 

2. Pass me your potato when ready, and I will cut it into its layers. Up at the whiteboard, we'll trace each layer to form a contour map.

3. Reconstruct your potato and compare it to the contour map on the whiteboard. List three things you can tell about your potato's "topography" just by looking at the contour map.

### Activity 3: Making our own contour maps

1. Using the gridded Temperature Field Map, start drawing contour lines that connect points of equal temperature.

2. Try drawing contour lines for the second map handout. This one may be trickier.

Remember the five most important rules of contour maps:
- **Contour lines connect points of equal value**

- **Contour lines never cross**

- **Contour lines separate uphill from downhill**

- **Contour lines never branch off or split**

- **All contour lines eventually connect to form circles (or go off the map)**
  - i.e., Make sure all your contour lines either connect to themselves or go to the edge of the map
