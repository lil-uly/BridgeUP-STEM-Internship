Today, we'll use for loops to format our "time" variable in mm/dd/yyyy format.

1. Remember that our time variable is in units of "days since Jan. 1, 1950," and has values like "17506 days".
How can you use these two pieces of information to figure out the real-time values of our time variable? (i.e. put it in a format of mm/dd/yyyy). 

2. Read about the [`datetime.date`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) and [`datetime.timedelta`](https://www.journaldev.com/23334/python-timedelta) functions. `datetime.date` allows us to represent a date in a computer-friendly format, by calling `datetime.date(year=__, month=__, day=__)` and filling in the appropriate values. 
`datetime.timedelta` allows us to represent an interval of time (i.e. a number of days) by calling `datetime.timedelta(days=__)` and filling in the appropriate values.

  First, you'll import datetime with `import datetime` at the top of your script.
  
  Then, practice by creating a datetime object for Dec. 10, 2018 and creating a timedelta object for 31 days. See what happens when you add them together!
  
3. Write a for loop that updates a list with the newly formatted dates. 

  What list or array do you want to loop through?
  What operation do you want to perform in the loop?
  Try writing "pseudocode" first, without worrying about the correct syntax of the for loop.
