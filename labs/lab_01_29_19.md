### 1. Today, we'll apply what we have learned about str.format and for loops to our dataset.

  Our goal is to write a script that plots and saves sea level anomaly for each date in our dataset.
  
  ### **a.** Open your Python script that plots sea level anomaly for a single day as a function of latitude and longitude. 
  **Resave it** with a new title that has the words "loop" and "SLA" and your initials in it.
  
  Go ahead and review the code you wrote before with a partner. What does each line do? 
  
  ## **b.** Write a function that plots SLA for an arbitrary date in our dataset and saves the data.
  
  What parts of the script need to be included in the function? (i.e, are there certain lines that are explicitly related to plotting?)
  
  What do you think the argument/input should be? Does it need to be a date or an index (or something else)? Does the function need to return an output?
  
  Test out your function on an arbitrary date and check the output. How does it look?
    
  ## **c.** Incorporating string formats
  Are there any aspects of your plot that you would like to change depending on the date in question?
  (i.e., what about the title?)
  
  Copy in the code you used to transform the time variable from "days since Jan. 1, 1950" to a datetime object (i.e. mm/dd/yyyy). How can you select the correct date from your time variable that corresponds to the day that you're plotting?
  
  Using the str.format tool we talked about last time, can you write a title for your plot that takes in a variable date value? 
  
  Test your function again and check the output. 
    
  ## **d.** If you're happy with your function, move onto the next step: Writing a for loop that plots and saves your data for each day in the dataset.
  
  When you write your for loop, test it on just a small subset of your dataset. (For example, if you're using the `range` function to loop through the numbers 1 through 100, sometimes you may want to test on the numbers 1 through 5, first. This is a common debugging strategy to check that the for loop is giving the correct output without wasting computing power.)
  
  ## **e.** Challenging: After you've run your test for loop, check your output! Do you have separate files for each day? If not, talk with a partner about what's happening.
  
  ## **f**. Extra bonus: Converting dates back to strings.
  Python has two features: strptime and strftime, that allow us to convert from these `datetime` objects to strings and vice versa. Using [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) on a datetime object allows us to print it out in any string format we want. For example, we can take the datetime object `datetime.date(2019,1,15)` and use `.strftime` on it to return just the year (2019). We can also return the date like this, `1/15/2019`, or this, `Jan. 15, 2019` or any other format we choose. 
  
  **Practice**: Create a datetime object for Jan. 15, 2019, and use strftime to write code that returns `1/15/2019`, `Jan. 15, 2019` and just the year `2019`. Check out [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) and its [references](http://strftime.org/). 
  
  Now, choose your own format for the observation dates in our dataset, and adjust your for loop to display the date in this format in the plot title.
