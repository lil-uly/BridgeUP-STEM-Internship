## Set up
- Open Terminal, and navigate to your GitHub repository in Terminal. [Add, commit and push any changes you have made.](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Oceans-Six/blob/master/coding_cheat_sheet.md) Then pull from upstream. 
- Open your netCDF.py script in Atom

## Tasks
1. Run the command in Atom that load your dataset. 

2. Take a look at the numpy arrays corresponding to each dimension variable (there are three!). Assign each array to a new, descriptive variable name (like `lat`). Do the same for our data variable.

3. We're going to make a pixel plot of our data, using Matplotlib's very simple [`pcolor` function](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor.html).
`pcolor` stands for pseudocolor plot. Think of a 2D space, like a grid of `latitude` and `longitude` points. Now every point in this space can have an additional property that can be described by a number, say a temperature or a height. In our case, this property is sea level anomaly. `pcolor` represents that property by a color that is then plotted. There are only three inputs necessary to create a pcolor plot: X (your longitude array), Y (your latitude array) and Z (your sea level anomaly array). 

     - First, you'll need to figure out what new library to import. Take a look at [this demo](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/pcolor_demo.html) and see if you can figure out the correct import statement. Go ahead and add it to the top of your script, with your other import statements. (Programming tip: We always put import statements at the top of a script, for organizational purposes.)  
     - Using [this demo](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/pcolor_demo.html) and [this documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor.html), use the `pcolor` function to plot a single day's worth of sea level anomaly as a function of latitude and longitude. Use Google and StackOverflow if you're having trouble figuring out the syntax. 
     - If you run into a mismatch with the dimensions while using pcolor: What is the size of our sea level anomaly array? Does it contain more than one day's worth of data? If so, how can you plot data from just a single day? Think back to our lessons on [numpy arrays](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Oceans-Six/blob/master/coding_cheat_sheet.md). 
          - Hint: You can pick any day you want -- you don't have to pick the first day of the dataset.
     
### DON'T FORGET TO ADD, COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES WITH GIT!
     
BONUS (if you finish early):
1. Add [x-axis and y-axis labels](https://matplotlib.org/users/text_intro.html) to your plot. You should also add a title.
2. Add a colorbar to your map, using these [demos](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.0/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_colorbar_with_inset_locator.html#sphx-glr-gallery-axes-grid1-demo-colorbar-with-inset-locator-py) and [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar.html). This [tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.07-customizing-colorbars.html) may also be helpful. 
This is a good example of a well-described map, with labels and a color bar.

3. Change the color scheme of your plot! You'll need the [cmap (color map)](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html) functionality to do this.
