# Happy Valentine's Day! 

## Today, we'll try to wrap up our plots of sea level anomaly using for loops.

### Here's a checklist of what you have accomplished, as well as what we still need to do.

- [x] Plot sea level anomaly from our dataset with the pcolor function
- [x] Write a function that plots SLA for any given day
- [x] Convert our dates variable from `x days since Jan. 1, 1950` to a mm/dd/yyyy format (i.e. 01-01-1993)
- [x] Use str.format to change the plot title in our function depending on the day argument
- [ ] Use str.format and our converted dates variable to make the plot date aware (i.e. printing `SLA on 1/1/1993`, rather than `SLA on day 1`)
- [ ] Save the output of our plot within our function
- [ ] Write a for loop with our function inside, so that we can plot all of our data at once! Don't worry about restricting the loop to the year of data you picked just yet â€“ try setting the range to select our entire dataset.
- [ ] Pick the range of our for loop so that we only plot a single year of data. Each pair can pick their own year.
- [ ] Run code!
- [ ] Make movie!
