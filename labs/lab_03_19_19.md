# Contour maps with matplotlib | 03-19-19

## We will continue using Matplotlib to make contour maps of our dataset.

### Jupyter Notebooks
1. Open up `Contours_with_matplotlib.py`. Find the cell that reads 
```python
def f(x, y): 
      return #your function here
```
and write your own custom function in here! You can be creative: Maybe you want to want to see what happens when f(x,y) is a quadratic function, or an average, or an exponent or log? 
You can also change the input variables (`x` and `y`).

2. Replot your contour maps with your new function. (Make sure to rerun the code block that generates `z` with this new `f(x,y)`!).

3. If you have time, practice changing the contour levels or create filled in contours with colorbars.

### Atom
1. Switch to Atom and open `matplotlib_contours_practice.py`. 

2. Follow the instructions to make contour maps of SLA.
