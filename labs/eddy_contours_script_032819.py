## Put any import statements here





## Load in our Bermuda SLA dataset here.





## Make a contour plot of a single day of sea level anomaly data here. 
## Make sure to save the contour plot as a variable!
## Use levels that are spaced evenly every 0.01 meters (this is the units of SLA)
day = 0





## Write a function that takes in a contour plot object and an index and 
## returns the level value at that index and a list containing all of the Path objects 
## for that level. (all of the contour lines that share that level value)




## Write code to create a Pandas dataframe where each contour line and 
## corresponding level is stored as an individual row.
## There are many ways you can do this. The goal is a dataframe that looks like:
