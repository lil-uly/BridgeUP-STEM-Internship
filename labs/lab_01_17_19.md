# Formatting strings | 01-17-19

We will be using the str.format function to create strings with changing inputs.

## str.format
Python has a cool tool for creating strings with variable values. 
For example, if I want to print out a string that contains someone's name and age, I can write `"My name is {} and I am {} years old".format('Katy', 24)`. The great part about this is that we can change the input to be anything, without having to rewrite the entire string or add strings together.

Discussion question (with a partner): Do you think str.format could be useful for while and for loops? If so, how?

## Objectives

### 1. Read more about the [str.format function here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-format-function/). 
  
  **(a)** With your partner, start with the string "My favorite movie is _______", and add in your favorite movie using str.format.
  
  **(b)** Using str.format, adjust your code from **(a)** to print out your favorite two movies.
  
  **(c)** Using str.format, adjust your code from **(b)** to print out your favorite two movies in order. I.e., "My favorite movie is _______ and my second favorite movie is ________." 
  
### 2. Now, practice writing a string that takes in 
  **(a) one variable input, 
  <br/> (b) two variables inputs, 
  <br/> (c) three variable inputs, and 
  <br/> (d) two variable inputs that have an order**  (see Code #4 in the link). 
  
  You can make your string anything you want. If you're not feeling particularly creative today, try writing strings about your favorite or least favorite subjects in school.
  
### 3. Write a for loop that loops over the names of your fellow interns and prints out "_______ is a intern in Ocean's Six" (replacing the ____ with an intern's name).

First, write a list in Python that contains all of the names you want to loop through.


### 4. You are given the list `dates = [datetime.date(1995, 10, 12), datetime.date(2000, 11, 17), datetime.date(2004, 3, 1), datetime.date(2012, 6, 30)]`. 
Suppose we have data on sea surface temperature in Bermuda on these four dates, and we want to plot the data for each date. Have Python print out sample titles for our plots of sea surface temperature that change, depending on the date in question. Make sure to use for loops! 

### Bonus: Converting dates back to strings.
  Python has two features: strptime and strftime, that allow us to convert from these `datetime` objects to strings and vice versa. Using [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) on a datetime object allows us to print it out in any string format we want. For example, we can take the datetime object `datetime.date(2019,1,15)` and use `.strftime` on it to return just the year (2019). We can also return the date like this, `1/15/2019`, or this, `Jan. 15, 2019` or any other format we choose. 
  
  **Practice**: Create a datetime object for Jan. 15, 2019, and use strftime to write code that returns `1/15/2019`, `Jan. 15, 2019` and just the year `2019`. Check out [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) and its [references](http://strftime.org/).
